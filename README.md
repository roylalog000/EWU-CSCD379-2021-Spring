In this assignment we are going to build out some of the logic needed for Secret Santa.
There have been several updates to the SecretSanta repository.
Key changes to be aware of:
- The data project has been expanded and contains users for groups and a new Assignment class.
- There is a new `GroupRepository` added to the business project.
- The gifts section links has been removed from the web project. The pages are still present but should not be needed.
- Opening the "edit" page of a group now also shows the users in a group, and has separate controls for editing the group and adding and removing users from the group.
- No additional Web or E2E tests are needed for this assignment.
