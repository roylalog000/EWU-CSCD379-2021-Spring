This is our code before we tried to do the azure deployment. This code is much more functional than the deployment version we created. We didn't want to outright delete our deployment since it did have some functionality, but we thought we would get more credit showing the code working in localhost. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Hers the the azure from the previous pull:

Azure Deployment: https://ewu-cscd379-2021-spring-roylalog000-assignment9.azurewebsites.net

To deploy/start, run "dotnet run DeploySampleData" in the API. 
The web project needs the npm install and npm run build:dev, then just the dotnet run.

Time spent in total is 30 - 35 hours working on this assignment since last week.(roughly 3 to 4 a day for the last 10 to 12 days).  This was a major jump in diffculty.
